# Responsive Design & Theming

## Responsive

- Phone-first: design and build for the smallest supported screen first.
- Treat responsive regressions as bugs — not polish.
- Use `useWindowDimensions()` to read screen dimensions — never `Dimensions.get()`.
- Use flexbox over fixed widths. Reserve fixed sizes for icons and avatars.
- Verify layouts on small devices (375pt wide) before considering a feature done.

### Wrapping square media grids

For a fixed-column media grid built with `flexWrap`, measure the available width
and give every tile concrete square bounds. Percentage width plus `aspectRatio`
directly on an image child can remain unresolved when its parent or media
renderer does not provide a reliable cross-axis size, producing counted but
blank or collapsed media.

```tsx
const { width } = useWindowDimensions();
const columns = 3;
const horizontalInsets = 48;
const gap = 8;
const tileSize =
  (width - horizontalInsets - gap * (columns - 1)) / columns;

<View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap }}>
  {media.map((item) => (
    <View
      key={item.id}
      style={{
        borderRadius: 12,
        height: tileSize,
        overflow: 'hidden',
        width: tileSize,
      }}
    >
      <MediaImage
        item={item}
        style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}
      />
    </View>
  ))}
</View>;
```

- Use `useWindowDimensions()` for a screen-width grid. If the grid is nested in a
  narrower container, measure that container with `onLayout` instead.
- Subtract horizontal insets and every inter-column gap before dividing by the
  column count.
- Apply the same measured dimensions to loading skeletons, real media, and
  overflow or "see all" tiles so state transitions do not shift the grid.
- Verify actual decoded media, not only query counts, at the smallest supported
  phone, a large phone, and increased text size.

## Theming (Light + Dark Mode)

- If a requirement mentions light or dark mode, implement both from the start — retrofitting costs more.
- Use semantic color tokens from `theme/colors.ts` via `useThemeColors()` — never hardcode hex values inline.
- Every color used in UI must resolve to both a light and a dark value through the token system.
- Test dark mode on a real device or simulator — color inversions that look fine in code often fail visually.
- Use `useColorScheme()` to read the active scheme; do not rely on `Appearance.getColorScheme()` directly.

## Theme Support Rules

If a task, design, or requirement includes both light theme and dark theme, implement both during the initial build.

- Ensure text, icons, borders, surfaces, backgrounds, shadows, overlays, and interaction states are properly styled for both themes.
- Do not leave any element partially themed or dependent on default colors that only work in one mode.
- Prefer theme-aware tokens, variables, or semantic classes over hardcoded color values.
- Ensure both themes are visually consistent, readable, accessible, and production-ready upon creation.

## Styling and Design System Rules

Keep styling consistent with the design system.

- Prefer tokens, semantic utility classes, or canonical shared styles.
- Prefer existing design-system components and spacing scales over one-off styling decisions.
- Do not create duplicate visual primitives when a shared version already exists.
- Keep shared text, spacing, radius, and color usage consistent.
- Keep table- or web-specific patterns out of mobile code unless the feature truly needs them.

## Responsive Design Standards

Responsive behavior is mandatory for user-facing UI.

- Design for phone first, then adapt for larger screens such as tablets.
- Do not rely on fixed widths that break on small devices.
- Prefer flexible layout, max widths, and responsive padding.
- Prevent clipped content and horizontal overflow.
- Scale typography for mobile readability.
- Keep tap targets large enough for touch interaction.
- Stack or wrap button groups when horizontal space is limited.
- Make forms mobile-friendly and full-width where appropriate.
- Ensure modals, sheets, and dialogs fit within the viewport and allow internal scrolling when necessary.
- Ensure images and media scale correctly without distortion.
- Respect safe area insets.

Responsive regressions should be treated as bugs.
