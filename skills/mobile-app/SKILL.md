USE when writing, reviewing, or refactoring any code in apps/*-mobile. TRIGGERS: creating components, screens, hooks, providers, features, data fetching, forms, navigation, performance work, accessibility, analytics, caching, state management, keyboard handling, safe areas, folder structure decisions. EXAMPLES: 'add a feature', 'build a screen', 'create a hook', 'audit this component', 'where should this go?', 'set up a query', 'add a mutation', 'fix keyboard hiding input', 'improve startup time', 'add safe area handling', 'handle Android back button'."

# Mobile App Skill

This skill **is** the implementation standard for the `apps/*-mobile` React Native Expo application. The detailed rules live in the `references/` files mapped below — read the ones your task touches before writing or reviewing code.

`apps/*-mobile/CLAUDE.md` and `apps/*-mobile/AGENTS.md` are thin entry points: they tell any agent to invoke this skill and carry only two things of their own — the **Design Skill Layering** authority order and the **Fix & Enhancement Workflow**. They do **not** hold topic content; when a rule is needed, come here. For all design guidance invoke `mobile-native-ui-design`.

> **Portability — `apps/*-mobile`.** This skill targets the workspace under `apps/` whose folder name ends in `-mobile` (the reliable cross-repo convention, alongside `*-admin`/`*-web` and `*-api`). Paths below are written as `apps/*-mobile/…`; substitute the actual folder name for the repo you are in. Do not hardcode a project-specific app name back into this skill — keep it suffix-based so it stays reusable.

---

## How to use this skill

1. **Match existing project patterns first** before introducing anything new — established tokens, components, Expo Router structure, NativeWind conventions, and feature-folder layout are the top authority.
2. **Open the reference(s) your task touches** from the [Quick reference map](#quick-reference-map). Every rule area has a dedicated file under `references/`; that file is the canonical source, not the summaries inlined lower in this doc.
3. **Skim `apps/*-mobile/AGENTS.md`** for the Design Skill Layering authority order and the Fix & Enhancement Workflow — those two live there, not here.
4. **Invoke `mobile-native-ui-design`** for screen-level work, navigation structure, Expo Router patterns, native tabs, Reanimated animations, and design quality — typography, spacing, color, tokens, accessibility states, and motion polish. **Always invoke when the user asks to enhance, improve, or redesign any UI screen or component.**

The mobile app rules, existing app tokens/components, Expo Router structure, NativeWind conventions, accessibility requirements, and platform behavior remain the implementation authority.

## Quick reference map

Every rule area has a dedicated file under `references/`. Each file is self-contained and canonical for its topic — the summaries later in this doc are pointers, not substitutes. `mobile-native-ui-design` is a **separate skill** (invoke it); everything else is a path in this skill.

> **`platform-design-guide.md` note:** this is the comprehensive "write once, feel native" design standard. Its navigation snippets use React Navigation (`createNativeStackNavigator`/`createBottomTabNavigator`) — the app uses **Expo Router**, so treat those code samples as illustrative of intent, not literal API. For navigation structure defer to `mobile-native-ui-design` and `references/platform-patterns.md`.

## Implementation workflow

When generating or modifying code, always follow this order:

1. Match existing project patterns first.
2. Choose the simplest implementation that fits.
3. Follow `references/folder-structure.md` for placement; keep screen entry files thin.
4. Colocate code by feature unless clearly shared.
5. Invoke `mobile-native-ui-design` before writing any UI. When implementing from
   an HTML prototype, read only its `data-app-root` as the visual/behavior contract;
   exclude preview shells and translate it to React Native primitives rather than
   a WebView or copied DOM/CSS.
6. Before writing the screen, resolve prototype state and actions through project
   configuration, the approved plan, foundations present in the repository, and
   nearby exemplars. Reuse the established GraphQL/codegen/TanStack Query,
   form-schema, API validation/authz, error, and cache paths when provided; use
   another stack only when the current project explicitly configures it. Never
   retain mock/local/manual mechanics merely to reproduce the demo quickly.
7. Use hooks, providers, and server-state tools consistently.
8. Check project shared components before building custom ones.
9. Add loading, empty, and error states for every async flow (`references/error-handling.md`, `references/ux-patterns.md` § Screen States).
10. Verify keyboard avoidance, safe areas, and scroll behavior on both platforms.
11. Protect perceived performance: startup first, then input responsiveness, scroll, layout stability (`references/performance.md`).
12. For performance changes, name the metric and explain why it improves.
13. For security-sensitive work, verify against `references/security.md`.
14. For protected device resources, verify native permission metadata and the rebuilt binary against `references/native-permissions.md`.
15. For user-facing UI, verify responsiveness, accessibility (`references/accessibility.md`), and both platform behaviors.
16. For server mutations, prefer targeted cache updates or invalidation over app reload.

## Common anti-patterns to avoid

_Canonical list with the "what to do instead" for each: `references/common-anti-patterns.md` and `references/core-principles.md`._

Do not:

- Over-abstract early
- Repeat fetch logic across components
- Dump feature logic into global utilities
- Use HOCs for logic that should be a hook
- Create unnecessary re-renders
- Force full app reload after mutations when targeted cache update suffices
- Invalidate the entire cache when only specific queries are affected
- Give stable, read-only reference lists a `staleTime` without also setting `refetchOnMount: true` when the global default is `refetchOnMount: 'always'` — they still refetch and flicker on every mount
- Silence type errors with broad `as` or `!`
- Scatter raw analytics calls across the codebase
- Treat responsive or safe area issues as optional polish
- Stack multiple UI signals that all communicate the same state unless each one adds different information
- Drill props through 3+ intermediate components
- Create effect render loops (read + write same state)
- Build custom components before checking shared primitives
- Add native dependencies when an Expo-compatible option already fits
- Assume a runtime permission request also generates native usage descriptions, or declare protected resources the feature does not use
- Copy iOS UI exactly into Android or Material UI exactly into iOS
- Ship prototype HTML in a WebView, recreate a DOM/CSS tree in React Native, or
  include a fake device frame/fixed preview canvas in the production screen
- Copy prototype mock arrays, local persistence, manual validation, hard-coded
  permissions, fake delays, or simulated requests into the production path
- Create separate screens per platform unless truly required
- Use hardcoded hex colors on icon `color` props — always use `useThemeColors()` tokens
- Import Ionicons, FontAwesome, Feather, or any icon library other than MaterialIcons
- Use `expo-symbols` / SF Symbols outside an iOS-only `.ios.tsx` file
