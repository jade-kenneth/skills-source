# State Management

## State Boundaries

Keep state boundaries clear.

| Layer | Where it belongs |
| --- | --- |
| Server state | Query or GraphQL caches |
| Client UI state | Components, hooks, or reducers |
| Session and auth state | Providers |

Do not duplicate the same source of truth across multiple layers unless synchronization is explicit and necessary.

## Prototype boundary

Prototype component state demonstrates an outcome; it does not choose the
production state owner. Do not port prototype arrays, mock entities, local
permission flags, or mutation results into `useState`, `useReducer`, Context, or
Zustand when the value belongs to the server, session, URL, or form. Map each
value first, keep server records in the query cache, and place optimistic changes
in that cache with rollback rather than maintaining a second local copy.

Avoid prop drilling through 3 or more levels of intermediate components. Use context, composition, or a state-management library when state is shared broadly.

## Decision Guide

| Situation | Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Simple local state | `useState` |
| Complex local state | `useReducer` |
| Shared structured state across several components | `useReducer` + Context |
| High-frequency shared state across many consumers | external store such as Zustand |

---

## When to Prefer `useReducer` Over Multiple `useState`

Prefer `useReducer` when:

- 3 or more state values update together
- The next state depends on the previous state
- Transitions are event-driven and easier to model with actions
- Update logic is becoming scattered across handlers

---

## Effect Rules

Do not create effect-driven render loops:

- Do not place hooks inside `useEffect`.
- Avoid effects that both read and write the same state dependency in a circular way.
- Prefer functional state updates when the next state depends on the previous state.
- Stabilize object and array dependencies with `useMemo`, `useRef`, or primitive dependency lists where appropriate.
